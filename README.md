# Quote Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Mission

I wanted to explore how I could use multiple sources for API calls, while creating a component that randomly generates quotes.

## To Do

### Transition

Use CSS transitions to make the .container elements fade to background color, before fading back to white at the end of the setTimeout() period, with new API info. To be used instead of loader.

## Completed`

### Format

Create card and layout.

### Use multiple API sources

Set multiple API sources, randomize which is selected on each render.

### Use Fallback data source

Create a fail-safe data source incase the APIs fail.

### Add loader and utilise setTimeout()

Use setTimeout() method in order to create consistent loading times, and create simple custom loader.
